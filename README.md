## Installation

1. Create a folder called LUCI_EE at the root of the C drive. i.e. *C:\LUCI_EE*
2. Download or clone this repository into folder you created in step 1. When asked for a location on your hard drive for the repository, choose *C:\LUCI_EE*.
3. In *ArcMap (Catalog window)*, connect to the LUCI-EntEx v1.0 folder (i.e. *C:\LUCI_EE*) using the *Connect to Folder* icon. Within this folder is **LUCI_EE.pyt** toolbox. Expand this toolbox to see tools of the *LUCI-EntEx v1.0* toolbox.

## Requirements
